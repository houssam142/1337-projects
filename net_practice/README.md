# Description
  NetPractice is a project designed to introduce the basics of IPv4 networking.It's goal is to help you understand IP addresses, subnet masks, and routers work by fixing broken network configurations.

# Instructions
  To get started with the exercises, follow these steps:

  1. Install the compressed file net_practice.1.7.tgz.
  
  2. Decompress with tar -xvf net_practice.1.7.tgz.

  3. Enter the directory and open index.html in a browser.

  4. Configure network: IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, router interfaces.

  5. Export each completed level configuration as a file.

  6. Submission: place all 10 exported configuration files (one per level) at the root of your repository.

  7. Complete all levels to finish the project.

# Resources
  • Networking concepts studied: TCP/IP addressing, subnet masks, default gateways, routers, switches, OSI layers.
